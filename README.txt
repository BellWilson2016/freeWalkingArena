Instructions for manufacturing freeWalkingArena1 and LEDdiffuser
JSB 8/2014

These can be laser cut out of plastic, but different thicknesses and types are used for different parts. Quick tip: For plastics that aren't laminated with a protective paper layer, sandwich them between pieces of paper or saran wrap to minimize charring. All scales are in mm. I’ve included AutoCAD DWG, DXF and Adobe Illustrator conversions.

The LEDdiffuser also uses these LED boards: https://github.com/joebell/LEDboard

For plastic I recommend:

1/8” White Acrylic for the diffuser. McMaster #8505K11

3/16" Clear Acrylic for the Floor, Sliders, Slider Stops, and Top Cap. (It's transparent, easy to cut precisely, and easy to tap screw threads into.) McMaster #8560K211 (2 sheets)

1/8" Delrin for the ceiling. (Opaque, chemical resistant.) McMaster #8573K13

1/32" Delrin for the Upper Wall. Good chemical resistance, good thickness. McMaster #8575K131

.020" PETG for the Lower Wall. This layer has the air inlets and outlets to each lane. This is thin enough that flies can't escape out the air inlets, but thick enough to not squish flies when combined with 1/32" Delrin. McMaster #9513K38

Other parts:

You'll want to tap holes for 8-32 thumbscrews in the floor, and 1/4-28 luer lock inlets in the ceiling. A tap handle is also helpful. McMaster #2522A868 #2521A821 #25605A63

8-32 thumbscrews (6 each of two different lengths, 5/16" and 1/2") McMaster #91830A205 #91830A208

Luer fittings and caps. McMaster #51525K23, #51525K37

The LEDdiffuser will require:

	 3 x LEDboards (see https://github.com/joebell/LEDboard)
	12 x 1” 4-40 threaded male-female standoffs McMaster #91075A685	
	12 x 1/4” 4-40 threaded female-female standoffs McMaster #96110A540
	 1 pk x 3/16” 4-40 machine screws McMaster #91772A105
	 1 pk x 4-40 nuts McMaster #90730A005
	 1 pk x 1/4-20 cap screws McMaster #91244A135	
	 1 pk x Rubber bumpers McMaster #8213K1
	1/4-20 tap McMaster #2521A771

Offset the 3 layers of plastic using the 1” standoffs. Attach the LEDboards to the top layer using the 1/4” standoffs. Tap the 1/4” holes for the 1/4-20 cap screws, use these as leveling adjustments with the rubber bumpers. These cap screws should sit directly on top of the central 6 thumbscrews in the behavior arena.
